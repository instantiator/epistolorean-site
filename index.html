        <h1>The Epistolorean</h1>
        <p>
          Epistolary books are written as letters or journals. They tell a story through the eyes the characters, capturing their thoughts, feelings, and events
          as and when they are recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Epistolorean brings your favourite epistolary books to life. You'll receive emails from the characters in the story, as they write their journals
          and letters.
